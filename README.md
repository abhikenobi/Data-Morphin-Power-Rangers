# Introduction
According to the United Nations:

On 28 July 2010, through Resolution 64/292, the United Nations General Assembly explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realisation of all human rights.

It is one of the foundations of a regionâ€™s public health and development and therefore, a topic very important at all levels of scrutiny national and local. However, not all sources of water are safe for human consumption (potable). 

Our goal with this project was to implement our education on machine learning to attempt to tackle a very crucial real-world issue. We used a public dataset found on Kaggle, along with models from SciKit Learn in order to train and test our dataset to see whether they could accurately classify a water sample as potable or non-potable. With our research, it was found that in order to determine water potability, multiple factors/attributes of the water sample would have to be looked at. Our dataset contained 9 attributes (i.e. features for our model).

# Dataset

The data set we used which included water quality data for 3276 different water bodies:
